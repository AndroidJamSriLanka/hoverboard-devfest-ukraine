For 20 years at DataArt we have built a great global team of more than 2400 professionals worldwide, of whom we are proud of and we strive to create for them the best conditions for work and life.  

At DataArt we have a unique culture which is based on our system of values developed over many years. We define values as the “the true North”, they guide our decisions and actions. Values create a sense of what is right and wrong and reflects how we will achieve our targets. We define our values in four words: People First, Expertise, Flexibility and Trust.

## What do DataArt values mean?

#### **PEOPLE FIRST:**
People and relationships are the foundation on which we have built our success. We invest in long-term partnership relations with our colleagues and clients.  
DataArt provides its employees with such employment benefits as medical insurance, paid sick leaves and vacations. Currently, table tennis, gaming consoles, and many others things are available at the workplace.

#### **FLEXIBILITY:**
DataArt hires people for the long haul: projects change, but our employees remain with us. If a project has ended or our colleagues become uncomfortable working on it, a transition to another project can be discussed with management.  
We don’t have a rigid hierarchy and bureaucracy, we provide a flexible work schedule, and an option to relocate to another office (temporary or permanently) at an employee’s request.
 
#### **EXPERTISE:**
All colleagues can improve their skills or change their specialization. For this matter, we have created the DataArt Edu - an educational program that consists of three main fields: technological, managerial, and lingual. Relatively speaking, English courses in DataArt are free for our employees.  
Also, there are many professional and social communities within DataArt.
 
#### **TRUST:**
We trust each other and do not accept a desire to control others. We prefer management via context and avoid micromanagement.  
And the last but not the least: 94% of members of our team are ready to recommend DataArt as a good employer to their friends and family and  87% want to spend a significant part of their career at DataArt (*answers >5 on a scale from 1 to 7, team satisfaction survey 2017’)​.

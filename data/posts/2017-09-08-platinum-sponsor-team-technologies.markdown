## We encourage you to experiment
and go beyond your comfort zone with our internal hackathons/workshops or playing alone. Constant learning and experiments spark our engineering curiosity. There is almost always a pretty great playground for failing fast, learning fast and improving even faster.

## Collaborate
Beside collaboration in the project teams we have competence center in mobile and cloud technologies that helps our engineers to share experience and grow together. Hm, eyah... and of course we support our kitchen debates with great coffee that helps folks to discuss issues and come up with ideas of solving them.

## Moonshot thinking
We believe engineering intelligence is the key element in delivering more with fewer efforts. It doesn’t mean we don’t work hard, it means we work smart - that’s what drives us/our innovation core. 

Team Technologies’ environment is open, honest and stimulating. 
We firmly believe true collaboration can only exist in the atmosphere of trust and support!

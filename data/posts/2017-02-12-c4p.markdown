## Why is it cool to speak at the DevFest?

DevFest Ukraine is not an ordinary tech conference, besides selecting only the best speakers, we help them to succeed in delivering an exceptional quality talk on the stage.

Here are few perks that all our speakers get:

- **Professional video recording**. We work with experienced video production companies to create session recording of the best quality. Stage, screen, audio, all is recorded separately and combined later. Check the [sample session video from the last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOwUnBkqmo4).
- **Exposure**. By being a speaker, you are proving your level of expertise to a potential business partners or employers. Your talk will be promoted in our online resources and recording published in YouTube channel with more than 35k views.
- **Unique networking**. Being a speaker means you’ll have the unique chance to network with other speakers - the best experts in the industry.
- **Coaching**. We're in the same boat, after being selected as a speaker our program committee will help you to deliver the best talk possible. We provide information about the audience, presentation templates, feedback on the slides, all to help you to prepare.

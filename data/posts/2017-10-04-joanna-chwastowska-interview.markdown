## 1. Joanna, we know you recently started working at DeepMind. Our congratulations! Please, tell a bit about the work you do. How did you first get involved into this work?
I’ve graduated computer science and worked as a software engineer for most of my life. In time, I grew to a tech lead, and then manager, scaling up, managing more teams, becoming a site lead for a startup. I still think of myself as a software engineer, even tho I haven’t been coding last couple of years… 

Being an Engineering Coach at DeepMind means putting emphasize on “people” part of an Engineering Manager role. Scaling the team up, paying attention to individuals, creating a safe space for people to take risks and grow.

## 2. What is the most challenging part of your work, and what is the most rewarding one?
My role is an experiment, something new, and quite undefined. It’s a big challenge - I need to find a space where I can add most value,  but influencing people only from a side. 

Doing things differently is hard, everyone tries to fit you into an existing box. Also not being able to reference yourself against others in the same role means you never know how well you’re doing;) 

But at the same time this freedom is what I embrace. Defining myself everyday, aiming to be a a help for engineers on our team, thinking about their growth, productivity, also building a bridge between engineering and other roles, and seeking ways to collaborate better.  
As you can see I’m not running out of things to work on :)

## 3. What is your favorite thing about this job?
First in my lifetime I can say that what I’m working on is saving lives. Literally. It’s a great privilege, and obligation at the same time. DeepMind Health combines broad impact of the project, with a startup engineering culture, all that at the verge of the newest technology.


## 4. Do you have any advice for someone interested in pursuing the same career?
Don’t pursue my career. Identify and pursue your own instead! ;)  
On a more serious note - don’t put yourself in a box of “this is what I am / want to be”. Be open for a change, be ready for a challenge, take on opportunities, risk, and fail, and learn, and never stop. Stay open - to new technology, new people, new areas and new roles.

## 5. Can you give us a sneak peek into your  GDG DevFest Ukraine talk? Why did you choose this subject?
I want to share a couple of thoughts on engineering growth. Sometimes when we’re focused on expanding our toolbox, and polishing technical skills, we forget about a bigger picture. About what we can achieve with those technical skills, and how we achieve big things in larger groups. How we grow from individual contributors into leaders with vision and impact.


## 6. How do you prefer to spend your free time?
My life is busy, and very active. To  relax I simply crawl into bed with a good book and a cup of tea. If I can replace bed with a sunny beach, and tea with red wine - even better :)


## 7. What do you think will be the next big trend in the industry in the next few years?
The world is moving fast, and sometimes it feels like we’re living in a future already - self driving cars, AI, quantum computers, robots, crypto currencies - people are working on all that as we speak. 

I feel like it’s not that much about which technology comes next, but more about how we use what we have already available to build solutions out of it. DeepMind Health is a great example of that - identify area where we can help, take existing technology, and make it useful in service of people.

## 8. Please advise us  a book or movie that impressed you the most recently.
I’m at the last chapter of “Ready player one” -  science fiction novel by Ernest Cline. I simply love it and can recommend to everyone:)

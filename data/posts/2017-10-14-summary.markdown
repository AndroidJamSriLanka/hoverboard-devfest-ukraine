We got a "full house" on Stage 2 when Anton Minashkin (Chief Software Engineer) was presenting.

Speakers were motivating the audience to create great products.Some of them were coding live. The audience really appreciated it.
The great mood of the participants and interesting content contributed to a large number of questions. During the breaks between the speeches, participants of Stage 3 actively became acquainted with each other, they made selphy and shared photos.
